When we train a machine learning model, it learns patterns, features, and relationships within the data. The model's goal is to generalize from the training data so that it can make accurate predictions on new, unseen data. The training process involves iteratively adjusting the model's parameters based on the training data and the chosen optimization algorithm.\n",

    "**Validation split**\n",
    "The validation split helps us to avoid overfitting (when the model performs well on the training data but poorly on new data) by providing a measure of how well the model is generalizing to unseen data. You adjust your model's hyperparameters based on its performance on the validation set.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Test Split**\n",
    "The test split is a completely independent subset of the data that is not used during the training or validation processes. It serves as a final evaluation of our model's performance. Once we've selected model and fine-tuned its hyperparameters using the validation set,we evaluate the model's performance on the test set. The test set provides an unbiased estimate of how well our model will perform on new, real-world data that it hasn't seen before. It helps us to assess whether our model has learned to generalize from the training data in a meaningful way."

Unsupervised learning doesn't require labeled data, making it suitable for anomaly detection tasks where we're trying to identify patterns that deviate from the norm."
